# liri-node-app

In this assignment, I made a command line node application called LIRI. 
LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. 

**Twitter API:** 
When a user types "my-tweets", the application will retrieve my most recent, 20 Twitter tweets. 

**Spotify API: **
When a user types "spotify-this-song SONG NAME", the application will retrieve the following: 

- Artist(s)
- The song's name
- A preview link of the song from Spotify
- The album that the song is from
- If no song is provided then your program will default to "The Sign" by Ace of Base.

**OMDB API:**
When a user types "movie-this MOVIE TITLE", the terminal will output the following: 

- Title of the movie.
- Year the movie came out.
- IMDB Rating of the movie.
- Rotten Tomatoes Rating of the movie.
- Country where the movie was produced.
- Language of the movie.
- Plot of the movie.
-  Actors in the movie.

Lastly, if the user types "do-what-it-says", the terminal will output the song details for Backstreet Boys' "I Want it That Way."
